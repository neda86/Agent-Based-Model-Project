# Agent-Based-Model-Project

This Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) project, implemented using the Julia programming language, is designed to simulate the transmission of an infectious disease in a university environment. It realistically represents the movements and interactions of students and staff. The agents in this simulation adhere to rules that replicate actual behaviors such as maintaining social distance, wearing masks, and getting vaccinated. This approach allows for the examination of how these practices can help control an outbreak. Each agent is characterized by unique statuses and actions, enabling the tracking of the disease's spread and the identification of effective prevention techniques. The primary goal of this project is to gain a deeper understanding of how to manage and reduce the spread of infectious diseases within a university context.
